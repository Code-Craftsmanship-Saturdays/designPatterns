# Design Patterns


## What is a Design Pattern?

## Four Essential Elements of Design Patterns
### Name

The handle whe can use to describe a design problem, its solution, and the consequences in a word or few.


### Problem

When to apply the pattern.  This can be:
- How to represent an algorithm as objects
- Class structures symtomatic to inflexible design
- List of conditions that must be met before it makes sense to use that particular pattern


### Solution

Elements that make up the design, their relationships, responsibilities, and collaborations.

The solution provides an abstract description of a design problem and how a general arrangement of elements (classes and objects in our case) solves it.

The solution does NOT describe a particular implementation.  It is a template that can be applied in may different situations.

### Consequences

The results and trade-offs of applying the pattern.


## Describing Design Patterns

### Purpose
- Creational: Describe the process of object creation
- Structural: Composition of classes or objects
- Behavioral: Ways in which classes or objects interact and distributes responsibility


### Scope
- Class
- Object

## Delegation

## Inheritance vs Composition

## Inheritance vs Paramerized Types
